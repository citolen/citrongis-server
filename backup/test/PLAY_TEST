Test for the backup script.

Introduce to test :
	  Two folder was created :
	      - The origin folder which is the representation of the current server
	      - The target folder which is the representation of the new server

Scenario:
	We want export all DB file and all extension form the current server and import this backup file on the new server  

How to start :
    ./launch_backup.sh
    		    The script will use the default value for all needed path (default value as been set on origin folder).
		    This will create a .zip file ( e.g : "backup-06-22-2014-18:31:10.zip" ) in the current folder.
 
    ./launch_backup.sh import <filename.zip> ./target/mongodb ./target/couchdb ./target/file
    		    With this line the default value will be override by the given parameters.
		    The folder "target" will be fulfilled by the original content of the origin folder.    		    

Important : You will notice that the mongodb.lock file and the couch.uri file are not in the target tree, that's normal, these two file was added to demonstrate that the script copy only the needed file for the DB export.
